# Chapter 7. Lesson 1. Introduction to tokens, chapter overview

###### tags: `Chapter 7`

Welcome to a new chapter. In this chapter, we are going to talk about more complex implementations of our contracts, especially about Jettons and NFTs. As you already know, everything in TON is a contract. Wallet is a contract. Logic of a smart contract is a contract. Jettons and NFTs are also smart contracts.

These smart contracts have standard implementations because we should agree on how we write the contracts and how their interfaces are structured so anybody knows how to interact with Jettons or NFTs. We're going to review a repository that holds all the standards on which the community already agreed so everyone is treating Jettons and NFTs in certain ways.

And we're going to dig even deeper, to review the code of the standard implementation. The standard is simply defining the requirements for the contract, its certain behavior from the outside. But there are also standard implementations. Certain contracts already published implement all the logic with the best practices of the standard. These are present both for Jettons and NFTs, and we are going to review their code.

You will understand the overall logic. There is not just a single contract for Jettons, there is more. We have minter and wallet contracts. You will understand their logic in the next lesson. The same is  for NFTs. There are collection contracts, and then there are item contracts. You will learn more about how they function, interact with each other, and how you can know much more about FunC itself by learning those standard implementations and seeing how things can be implemented. As a result, youâ€™ll be able to use this knowledge later, when you will write your own contracts. I'm super excited about this; let's jump to the next lesson.
