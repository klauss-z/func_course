# Chapter 3. Lesson 6. Flexible deployment from testnet to mainnet
###### tags: `Chapter 3`

In this lesson, we are going to adjust our script to actually be flexible between testnet and mainnet. Then we will learn to deploy our contract to mainnet as well.

This will include a new, environment variable **testnet**. We will set this in our script, so it will know what network it must use. According to this new variable, we will also adjust our code.

### Adding an environment variable

First, let's *update the script section*. We’ll start with adding `mainnet` to the script:

```
"deploy:mainnet": "yarn compile && ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
```

Still, we want **testnet** as the default environmental variable. So we will make the **testnet** variable true:

```
"deploy": "TESTNET=true yarn compile && ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
```

Now, to use mainnet for deploy, you’ll have to explicitly announce it. Let’s also add `mainnet` for testing:

```
"onchaintest:mainnet": "ts-node ./scripts/onchaintest.ts"
```

This is how the whole **scripts** section looks then:

```
"scripts":
  "compile": "ts-node ./scripts/compile.ts"
  "test": "yarn compile 66 yarn jest",
  "deploy"; "TESTNET=true yarn compile && ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
  "deploy:mainnet": "yarn compile && ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
  "onchaintest": "ts-node ./scripts/onchaintest.ts",
  "onchaintest:mainnet": "ts-node ./scripts/onchaintest.ts" 
```

Next, we need to *configure* **dotenv** *variables*:

```
import dotenv from "dotenv"
dotenv.config();
```

For this, we need to install this library:

```
yarn add dotenv
```

Let's find where we need to change the code, where we are dependent on the testnet. It is obviously this subdomain in `deploy.ts`:

```
let link
  `https://test.tonhub.com/transfer/` +
  address.toString({
    testOnly: true,
  })
```

Update it, so if it is set as true, we are going to put the test here. Otherwise, we’ll just put an empty string:

```
let link
  `https://${process.env.TESTNET ? 'test.' : ""}.tonhub.com/transfer/` +
  address.toString({
    testOnly: process.env.TESTNET ? true : false,
  })
```

This is for the deploy. And *for the* `onchaintest.ts` *we will do the same thing*. First, configure the **dotenv**, just the same way as described above.

Then we *add choosing the right network*. If `process.env` uses **testnet**, we are going to use testnet as well; otherwise we’ll use mainnet:

```
const endpoint = await getHttV4Endpoint({
  network: process.env.TESTNET ? "testnet": "mainnet",
});
```

Also, we need to search for other environmental dependencies in our project and change them the same way for the connection to be proper.

### Modifying the logs

We can *update our console logs on deploy* to actually say to which network the project will be deployed. If process.env is **testnet**, we will say testnet, otherwise we will say mainnet:

```
console. log (
  `The address of the contract is following: $address. toString()}*
);
console. log (
  Please scan the QR code below to deploy the contract to ${
    process.env.TESTET ? "tesnet" : "mainnet"
  }:`
);
```

Now we'll add the environment variable where it should be: before the run script, not the compile script.

```
"scripts": {
  "compile": "ts-node ./scripts/compile.ts",
  "test": "yarn compile && yarn jest"
  "deploy": "yarn compile && TESTNET=true ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
  "deploy:mainnet": "yarn compile && ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
  "onchaintest": "TESTNET=true ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
  "onchaintest:mainnet": "ts-node ./scripts/deploy.ts"
```

Let’s run it again. Now it’s deployed to testnet by default. If we want to deploy to mainnet, we can use the command 

```
yarn deploy:mainnet
```

The logs we improved now show us whether to testnet or mainnet we deploy.

### Deploying to the mainnet

Now, I’m going to actually deploy it to the mainnet, via Tonhub, so we can see it on Explorer. I need to *scan the QR code and confirm the deploy transaction on Tonhub with real money*. After that, we can find our transaction using Tonscan.

We have also adjusted the script of the on-chain test to work with testnet or mainnet the same way. So far, you made it through the whole life cycle of the contract development. Congratulations!


### Conclusion

We’ve built just a custom setup; you don't have to use it this way. We went through every step – compiling, testing, deploy – so you have a better understanding of how it works. You will find more and more tools that will put you on a higher level of abstraction. This is good: even top developers who know all the details like to get away from manual operations at the low level. Most of the time you will probably use Blueprint.

In the next chapter, we are going to write more FunC logic, some more tests, and change our script so it would be completely the same as in Blueprint. We will start using Blueprint under the hood  a lot.

What you've learned as far is going to be very useful for you in the next chapters. But feel free to just use Blueprint and simply generate empty projects with all the files necessary. Now you know how to use them, you understand the process and the requirements to compile and deploy your own contracts.

Thank you for joining me in this chapter! I'm looking forward to meeting you in the next one. I'm really happy for you to have so much motivation that you’ve made it this far in programming. See you soon!
