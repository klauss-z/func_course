# Chapter 5. Lesson 5. Delpoying dapp to Github
###### tags: `Chapter 5`

I believe that the best place to publish dapps is **GitHub Pages**, not just for development, but also for production. GitHub Pages is a free service for open source projects that allows to publish static websites based on HTML/CSS/JS directly from a GitHub repository.

Since all the dapps should always be open source, all the apps qualify here. GitHub Pages also supports custom domains, so the end result will be identical to other production publishing services. Another benefit of GitHub Pages is that it supports static websites only — it only runs client side. There is no backend that can run code or server side rendering. This limitation is actually a feature for us because decentralized apps should never depend on backend services, as those are centralized.

The last important feature for GitHub Pages that makes it very appropriate for dapps is its reliance on Git repos, which gives us many community governance features for free. For example, a group of maintainers can share the website deployment privilege easily because all of them have certain access to the repository. Collaborators from the community can submit pull requests, and these can get merged. Community members can influence dapps in live mode. And finally, if anyone from the community isn't happy with how the dapp is governed, they can always fork the initial GitHub repository and create their own independent client that can also be published to GitHub pages in one click.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages
We have our web application locally. As we just discussed, it is only a front end part. The back end part is the smart contract of our dapp. Let’s deploy to GitHub pages.

First, we need to *create a new repository* to push our code into. But before we start, let's talk a bit more about how our repository will transfer into a web page.

As you might have guessed, GitHub Pages are closely connected to your GitHub account. So, let's assume you have the username; mine is @markokhman, so I enter it. Then you enter a repository name that will be available as a first part of the path. Let’s name it `first_contract_front_end`. Now we can press **Create repository**. 

Now we’ll start *committing our code* by parts. Of course we can commit the whole code at once, but some parts of it must be treated in a special way. We copy the URL of our GitHub repository and head back into our IDE to initiate our Git repository. At the quick setup page you can find commands to help you:

```
echo "# first_contract_front_end" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/markokhman/first_contract_front_end.git
git push -u origin main
```

We start with this:

```
git init
```

Git repository is initialized, and we already have `.gitignore` file. Great. Now let’s add everything there:

```
git add .
```

Commit an initial commit:

```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Now I call our remote origin, the link I copied from the GitHub repository before:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/markokhman/first_contract_front_end.git
```

Then I make first push, which includes our initial code:

```
git push origin master
```

Let's get back to GitHub and talk a little bit about how GitHub Pages work. Basically, we have a username and a name of our repository. How is it going to work with website hosted on GitHub pages later on? **Markokhman**, my user name, is going to be used as a subdomain. Then I add github.io as a domain, and then I'm going to have the name of my repository:

```
markokhman.github.io/first_contract_front_end/
```

##### Creating new manifest file

Here our website will be published soon, and now we have to prepare for it. But before we continue, let's remember that you also have to do the manifest. As you remember, you're still using my manifest file.

How can you create your own manifest file that is also available under the public folder? Go to the `main.tsx` file. There you can see the URL of my manifest file. Let’s create a new one to be placed in the public folder, and call it `tonconnect-manifest.json`.

We know the structure, it's going to be URL. I'm going to still use my website:


```
"url": "https:///join.toncompany.org"
```


Then we go with the name:


```
"name": "TON&Co. Tutorial"
```


And then goes the icon URL. We want it to be a part of our repository as well. So now I'm going to place an icon file here in the `public` folder, but later I will actually compose a proper URL here that will actually refer to this file once we deploy it. As yet, the link looks like this, because the public folder is actually resolving to the root once we build the project:


```
"iconUrl": "https://markokhman.github.io/first_contract_front_end/icon.png"
```


So here is our whole new manifest file:


```
{
"url": "https://join.toncompany.org",
"name": "TON&Co. Tutorial",
"iconUrl": "https://markokhman.github.jo/first_contract_front_end/icon.png"
}
```


Now we go head to the main.tsx file and compose a proper URL here:


```
const manifestUrl = "https://markokhman.github.io/first_contract_front_end/tonconnect-manifest.json"
```


Last thing we need to do now is to prepare `vite` itself to build properly for us. As you can see here, the vite config has a base:


```
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react (), nodePolyfills()],
  base: "/",
});
```


This base is not going to be root because we have another base: `first_contract_front_end` in my case. These are the rules of GitHub: the repository name must be the base path. So let’s put it as the base of our project:

```
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react (), nodePolyfills()],
  base: "/first_contract_front_end/",
});
```

### Creating GitHub workflow
At this point, we are good with our existing code, but there is one more thing we need to do. First of all, let’s run

```
yarn build
```

This builds servable files that are executable in the browser, with all our TypeScript and stuff. Obviously, it cannot work right in the browser, so we need to build it. In the `dist` folder we have `index.html` with all the proper paths, Here we have all the files, kind of bundled.

But we don't want to `yarn build` every time we push some changes to the repository. The contents of `dist` folder are even “gitignored”. In GitHub, a repository branch is considered as the branch that is containing the contents of the website at GitHub pages. Potentially, we can just create a branch that only has the contents of the folder we need, and this branch will be connected directly to the URL we just described.

We can optimize it, so every time you push any changes from the local machine to GitHub, they will be prepared automatically, so the GitHub pages will be created automatically and include all the current contents of the `dist` folder. For this, GitHub has another cool thing — **workflows**.
 
Now we are going to create a workflow that will do the job for us every time we push to the repository. In our project root folder we *create a new repository* called `.github`. Inside of it, we *create another folder* called `workflows`. These are the standard names, so you cannot change them. In the workflows folder we *create a file* named `deploy` with `*.yml` extension. There I paste this code:


```
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
      runs=on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - name: Checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Setup Node
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: 16

        - name: Install dependencies
          uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1

        - name: Build project
          run: npm run build

        - name: Upload production-ready build files
          uses: actions/upload artifact@v2
          with:
            name: production-files
            path: ./dist

  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'

    steps:
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: production-files
          path: ./dist

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```


This workflow named `deploy` will trigger on any push that happens on the master branch. And then we *start to define jobs*. It has two jobs, `build` and `deploy`. You don't need to install anything, it's just GitHub terminology for the configuration, the syntax.

In `build`, we specify the environment that it runs on. You should check out the repo, set up the node for runtime and the version of the node that you need. Then you can `npm-install` something. The end result will be a build folder dist, just like we have locally.

The next job is `deploy`. Here we provide the information on how we should download artifacts of this `dist` folder and deploy them to GitHub pages. For the deploy, a new GitHub Pages branch is created.

We save this file. As you remember, we already committed it. We check git status with `git status` command and see that one file was updated – `vite.config.ts`. Then we check the manifest: move to `tonconnect-manifest.json`, add everything with `git add .` command and commit it with `git commit`.

Finally, we move to .gitignore folder, check that public folder is not ignored, and commit it as a workflow:

```
git commit -m "Workflow"
```

Great, we have this workflow ready! Let’s move to our GitHub repository settings, **Actions** > **General**, and ensure Workflow permissions are set to “read and write”; otherwise we won’t be able to create a folder.

##### Pushing the code

The next step is pushing whatever we committed. Get back to `.gitignore` and use the command:


```
git push origin master
```


Head to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository and see your workflow running. Refresh if necessary:

![Workflow is running](https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/5.5.jpg?raw=true)

You can click a workflow and see what it’s doing at the moment:

![Workflow is running](https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/5.5_2.jpg?raw=true)

The result of this workflow will be a new branch called `gh-pages`. Every time we push something to `main`, this workflow will run and update this new branch, actually by recreating it, so it has the latest build after the `deploy` job is finished.

Now in the branches we can see a new `gh-pages` branch with a new deployment. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** and in the **Build and Deployment** section choose `gh-pages` branch.

Go back to **Actions**. There you’ll see one more action is running — this is what is going to deploy our `dist` folder to our subdomain. Let's see what is going on inside:

![Build and deployment](https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/5.5_3.png?raw=true)

##### Testing the GitHub page

After this process is finished, go to **Settings** > **Pages**, and at the top you’ll see a link to our website. We're heading to this website and see it working just like on our local machine.

Let’s test it. Press **Connect Wallet**, choose **Wallet** > **Tonkeeper** and scan the QR code. As we upgraded the manifest file, we can see the icon and the name. As the wallet is connected, we see our site with all action buttons.

![The site at GitHub Pages](https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/5.5_4.jpg?raw=true)

I click **Increment by five** and see this all happening on the domain. This is a published production app now. I confirm the transaction with my wallet. Once the blockchain data is updated, we will see 10 as a counter value. And our contract balance also increased, because I spent some money to deliver this transaction.

### Conclusion
We've just deployed our first application to production. This is working the same way for the testnet and the mainnet. It's just up to you what credentials and code you want to push there. By this point, you’ve made a web application that is running publicly for people. Quite a good progress we made in the last few chapters!

So before I announce to you what we are going to do in the next lessons, let me give credits to [**Orbs**](https://www.orbs.com/) team, and namely, **Shahar Yakir** and **Tal Kol** — these guys prepared many materials  I was using while learning this thing before explaining it to you. And I used some of their materials while preparing these lessons for you. So I really want to give them credits and kudos. You can find links to their projects in the materials to this lesson, and I would really appreciate it if you go and check it out. [TON Access](https://www.orbs.com/ton-access/), the library that we were using in these lessons, was also made by Orbs team, so I really encourage you to check their products, because these are the coolest tools for development you can find.

Finally, let me spoil a little about the next chapter. There we are going to learn how to embed the interface we just built right into the Telegram with its web apps. I'm sure you're going to like it. Another thing we're going to do in the next chapter is building a chatbot interface instead of web style one. The chatbot will interact with your user so he can make something with the wallet. You will learn this concept and understand the difference between the chatbot interface and the web interface we just saw.

I really look forward to the next chapter where we're going to expand our knowledge to new horizons. Stay tuned!
