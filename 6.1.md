# Chapter 6. Lesson 1. Telegram chatbot credentials

###### tags: `Chapter 6`

In this chapter, we are going to have a closer look on the new way of distributing our application. We've published it to the GitHub Pages  and now it is available for anyone on the web via browser. However, to bring better adoption to your application, you want it to be accessible seamlessly from the place where you already have the attention focused.

The messenger is one of the greatest ways to do that. Let's say, one of your users is sharing your app with his friend or a group of people. The most seamless way to onboard these new users is not moving them to the browser, but enabling them to use your app right in the messenger, natively. Telegram is an amazing messenger with unprecedented traction and ambitions. It really delivers. Telegram has up to 700 million monthly active users and over 50 million daily active users. What a massive potential user base for your app!

Already for a while, Telegram bots are a great way to program interactions with telegram users. Telegram bots can completely replace any website. They support seamless authorization, integrated payments via 15 payment providers,  with Google Pay and Apple Pay out of the box. They deliver tailored push notifications to users and much more.

With web apps, a feature  introduced recently, bots get a whole new dimension. Bot developers can create infinitely flexible interfaces with JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. The chat interface has shown a lot of traction, though we all are used to graphical user interface for the most of our needs.

We want our app to be accessible seamlessly for lots of users, so they can easily share this experience with their loved ones. We are going to make our next step and configure our app to work with Telegram as a web app.

### Diving into Telegram web apps

Let's have a closer look at what Telegram web apps look like. At the [Telegram homepage](www.telegram.org) we are heading straight to the APIs and see [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots) as one of the first ones. Here we see a new feature — Telegram web apps. They are acting inside of the bot, but provide the possibility to create a web interface embedded into the bot.

It can be used for many things: for receiving payments, for other custom things, for processing files and specific tasks. You can also integrate it with other services, like GMail, as the example shows. And you can also host games.

Telegram web apps go beyond basic, request-answer interaction. This is why it's a very handful and actually important thing to master — it will give you numerous benefits in any projects you ever want to launch.

Let's see how it is integrated. We head to the [Web Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) section. We have already built a web application, so now we need to integrate it into this bot. Then we’ll be able to change the color scheme and the language based on a user's device settings.

The integration is quite seamless. Telegram web application can be launched in the bot with keyboard button, inline button, or with bot menu button. Bot menu button is what we're going to use in next lessons. [Web Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) section is a very great resource to actually learn the possibilities of Telegram web apps.

We have already built a web application accessible on the browser. Now we need to know how to integrate it with the APIs of Telegram. Telegram is providing us with a script that we can simply load and access numerous features, like color scheme, platform, screen size detection, and others.

Now we need to integrate our app with a script. Let’s find an SDK that will help us to do this with React. Luckily, we [have it](https://github.com/twa-dev/SDK) — the link will also be available to extra materials to these lessons. Simply install this library:


```
npm i @twa-dev/sdk
```


It enables us to access the methods of the script. In the next lesson we are going to create our bot, learn how to integrate what we already have and then improve our app so it would interact with the bot APIs more efficiently.
