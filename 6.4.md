# Chapter 6. Lesson 4. Programming command-driven chatbot interface

###### tags: `Chapter 6`


In this lesson we are going to *create one more project — a chatbot*. This is going to be a backend project because this is how chatbots are working. You write some script that is running on your server. And you use the API key to connect to the Telegram server. Your script can get updates from the Telegram server when the new messages comes. You can trigger new messages on behalf of your chatbot. Basically, this is a separate application.

We've got our contract, we deployed it — this is like a backend of our dapp. Then we created a web interface, so anybody on the web can access it and interact with it. Then we created a TWA (Telegram web application), adopted it to be actually embedded into Telegram. One more thing we want to do is to write a script that is going to control and program this conversation: offer a keyboard, ask some questions, and then trigger certain actions on answers. And of course, interact with TON because we are building an interface for our contract that is on blockchain.

### Preparing to start

We start a new project with creating a new directory and moving to it:

```
mkdir first_contract_tg_bot
cd first_contract_tg_bot
```

Now we setup a new package:

```
yarn init
```

Time to install a few libraries. We keep working with TypeScript, so the first thing we're gonna do is install `typescript` for node, `types` for node, and `swc/core` that compiles TypeScript into JavaScript:

```
yarn add typescript ts-node @types/node @swc/core --dev
```

We need to create a new file here, called `tsconfig.json`, with the following content:


```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "resolve]sonModule": true
  },
  "ts-node": {
    "transpileOnly": true,
    "transpiler": "ts-node/transpilers/swc"
  }
}
```

Here we have the configuration for the transpiler of TypeScript and a pretty standard configuration for compiler.

This project is empty. We need to install a new SDK that will help us interact with the chatbot API. The SDK that I would suggest is called Telegraf:

```
yarn add telegraf
```

While it's installing, let me go back to the browser and show you some of its [documentation](https://telegrafjs.org/#/?id=example). It's quite easy to start with and quite a handful when you want to create even complex chatbots. 

##### Programming the chatbot

We got Telegraf installed. Now we are going to create `src` folder in the root directory, and `index.tx` file in this folder. Then we immediately create a script in `package.json` and run our code from the command line.

```
{
  "name": "first_contract_tg_bot"
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index. js",
  "license": "MIT"
  "devDependencies": {
    "@swc/core"; "^1.3.42",
    "@types/node": "^18.15.9",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
    "typescript": "^5.0.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "telegraf": "^4.12.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

The script is going to use `ts-node` to actually run this `index.ts` we are going to program in. Let's go to the example [here](https://telegrafjs.org/#/?id=example). Of course, this is not a TypeScript example of API, but we got some code prepared. First, we have to import Telegraf in a TypeScript way:

```
import { Telegraf } from "telegraf";
```

Next thing we need to do is initiate a bot instance. So we are creating an instance of Telegraf:

```
const bot = new Telegraf(' ');
```

The first thing it will accept is the token. You've already seen this token when we were working with BotFather API. So we need to [go back](https://github.com/markokhman/func-course/blob/main/Chapter%206/Lesson%202.md), see what our token is and copy it to initiate the bot instance here locally:

```
const bot = new Telegraf("6015353320:AAF4LZh2hvZSRHQcZNDMyuePl41yd2ZAMyM");
```

When you develop chatbots, you should keep two instances of those, one for testing and one for production.  So we’re going to separate those tokens with `env` variable. In `src` folder we create a new file called `.env` to keep track that this file is never committed into your repository. We'll call it `TG_BOT_TOKEN` and start .env file with it:

```
TG_BOT_TOKEN=6015353320:AAF4LZh2hvZSRHQcZNDMyuePl41yd2ZAMyM
```

The library that helps us to interact with these variables is called `dotenv`, let’s add it:

```
yarn add dotenv
```

Once installed, we can access it from `index.ts`:

```
const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.TG_BOT_TOKEN!);
```

But first we need to configure this `dotenv` and import it. So let's do it in the very beginning of this file:

```
import dotenv from "dotenv"
```

An important thing is to run the `dotenv.config` function as soon as possible in your project, so after the imports we add

```
dotenv.config();
```

This variable is possibly undefined, but we know that we actually define it here in .env. So we are going to say that it's going to be there for sure. And it will fail if it's not there, so it will not initiate a Telegraf instance.

Cool, so let's see how our sample code looks once we start bot interaction step by step:

```
bot.start((ctx) =>
  ctx. reply ("Welcome to our counter app!", {
    reply_markup: {
      keyboard: [
        ["Increment by 5"],
        ["Deposit 1 TON"],
        ["Withdraw 0.7 TON"),
      ],
    },
  })
);
```

This Telegraf bot instance gives us a method `start`. It will be triggered when you first enter your chatbot: as you remember, when we just opened the chatbot, we clicked start. Once you run the first message, you’ll reply with a welcoming message and attach a keyboard.

We’ll see what this keyboard will look like. Telegram chatbots let you create your own keyboard to replace the original keyboard you see when you type a message. You can also make inline keyboards placed right under messages. We’ll talk about them later; now we are going to use just a simple keyboard.

Here we will create three rows and three buttons. On the web it’s suitable to “request” a transaction, like “request deposit”, because you authorize applications to make requests from you. But here we have direct transaction links, you don’t have this session with chatbot itself, so action verbs in the buttons are more appropriate, like “deposit”. Of course, you can keep a session on the backend, but it's not the way it should be done because it creates a security vulnerability.


```
bot.hears("Increment by 5", (ctx) => {
  // TODO: send increment transaction
  ctx reply("Incremented by 5");
});
bot.hears("Deposit 1 TON", (ctx) => {
  // TODO: send deposit transaction
  ctx reply("Deposited 1 TON");
});

bot.hears ("Withdraw 0.7 TON", (ctx) => 
  // TODO: send withdraw transaction
  ctx reply("Withdrawn 0.7 TON");
});
```

There we have a few functions. `bot.hears` means the bot gets the message like this. We can send a reply “Incremented by five”. And then we can also add similar replies.

Finally, we add a function to start the bot and a few lines of code to make sure that we're exiting the bot properly:


```
bot.launch();

// Enable graceful stop
process.once("SIGINT", () => bot.stop("SIGINT"));
process.once("SIGTERM", () => bot.stop ("SIGTERM"));
```

Ok, we’re all set, let’s launch:


```
yarn start
```

Our bot is working, but it’s important thing is to check it in the app. Let’s open our bot and click Start again:

https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/6.4_1.jpg?raw=true

As you can see, we have three buttons with our text. After we click any of them, we get the reply we want. And if we click Counter, our app will open as a web app. So how can we make the menu actions work?

### Making menu actions work

Let's get back to [one of our first lessons](https://github.com/markokhman/func-course/blob/main/Chapter%203/Lesson%204.md) on programming. We were creating a deploy script. As you remember, we composed a link that can be scanned as a QR code, and direct to the wallet where we can sign a transaction to deploy the contract. We can do the same thing now. Once your user gets the option, like, to increment by five, you can create a link that would move him directly to the Tonhub for payment.

First, let's install libraries required to work with TON:

```
yarn add ton-core ton-crypto
```

We will need ton-core to compose the message, and also ton-crypto. To form the link we will need these libraries:

```
yarn add qs @types/qs --dev
```

Now we’ll reuse some code from the first lesson. Make sure that our contract address is proper. You remember, in the `first_contract_front_end` project we created a hook that was attaching to a certain contract. Let's take the address from `useMainContract.ts`:

```
const mainContract = useAsyncInitialize(async () => {

  if (!client) return;

  const contract = new MainContract(

    Address.parse("EQBDUxTxWo41aCY1SGZJJlDnu4uKvZtbOjuGF9mtf22M1UBq") // replace with your address from tutorial 2 step 8

  );

  return client.open(contract) as OpenedContract&lt;MainContract>;

}, [client]);
```

Now we need to import the address construct.

```
bot. hears ("Increment by 5", (ctx) => {
  let link =
    `https://test.tonhub.com/transfer/` +
  Address.parse ("EQBDUxTxWo41aCY1SGZJJlDnu4uKvZtbOjuGF9mtf22M1UBq").toString
    RestOnly: true,
```

We're not going to do anything with mainnet here, it's only testnet. We are parsing the address class out of the certain address, then we transform it to string. Actually, we can just do it directly, because we obviously need a string here. Then, let's recompose it, make the code cleaner:

```
bot. hears ("Increment by 5", (ctx) => {
  let link = `https://test.tonhub.com/transfer/EQBDUxTxWo41aCY1SGZJJlDnu4uKvZtbOjuGF9mtf22M1UBq?${qs.stringify(
    {
      text: "Simple test transaction",
      amount: toNano ("0.05") . toString (10) ,
      bin: msg body toBoc({ idx: false }). toString ("base64"),
    }
)}`;
```

We can even do like this: 

```
​​const SC_ADDRESS = "EQBDUxTxWo41aCY1SGZJJ1Dnu4uKvZtb0juGF9mtf22M1UBq";
```

So we put smart contract address here into the link:

```
bot.hears ("Increment by 5", (ctx) => {
  let link = `https://test.tonhub.com/transfer/${SC_ADDRESS}?$ {qs.stringify(
    {
      text: "Simple test transaction",
      amount: toNano ("0.05") . toString (10) ,
      bin: msg body toBoc({ idx: false }). toString ("base64"),
    }
)}`;
```

You can even do one more improvement. Just like we did with the environment variable for the token, we can do this with smart contract address in `.env`, because in production you will probably also have a contract on mainnet:


```
SC_ADDRESS=EQBDUxTxWo41aCY1SGZJJ1Dnu4uKvZtb0juGF9mtf22M1UBq
```

Now in `index.ts` we don't need address object anymore.

```
import { Address } from "ton-core";
```

In the `Amount` in `bot.hears` we choose `Add import from "ton-core"` from context menu and add `process.env` to the link:

```
bot.hears ("Increment by 5", (ctx) => {
  let link = `https://test.tonhub.com/transfer/${process.env.SC_ADDRESS}?$ {qs.stringify(
    {
      text: "Simple test transaction",
      amount: toNano("0.05").toString(10),
      bin: msg_body.toBoc({ idx: false }).toString("base64"),
    }
)}`;
```

Here we need to form a message body. What is a message body? You use builder, because you are going to put the message body as a cell and TON transforms it to the string representation. What do we put in this message body?

We were creating the contract and a wrapper for it. We are going to send an increment function. For this, we can actually just copy this message body from **wrappers > MainContract.ts**:

```
const msg_body = beginCell()
  .storeUint(1, 32) // OP code
  .storeUint(increment_by, 32) // increment_by value
  .endCell();
```
        
It shows the integer that we want to increment and the integer by how much we want to increment. All of these I’ll copy to my bot project:

```
bot.hears("Increment by 5", (ctx) => {

const msg_body = beginCell() 
    .storeUint(1, 32)
    .storeUint(5, 32)
    .endCell();

let link = `https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/${process.env.SC_ADDRESS
}?${qs.stringify(
    {
      text: "Simple test transaction",
      amount: toNano("0.05").toString(10),
      bin: msg_body.toBoc({ idx: false }).toString("base64"),
    }
)}`;
``` 
   
We don't ask for the increment, we know it's 5, so we put 5 here. You can play around with it and ask the amount to increase. In our case, we have 5 hard coded now. Now we import qs in the beginning:

```
import qs from "qs";
```

Great, we imported everything, let’s stringify the object.  We say to increment the counter by five — this is just a text attached to the message. Then we say to put 0.05 as an amount to actually pay the transaction fees and stuff. Then we use this parameter fee.

Here we head to [Tonhub developers](developers.tonhub.com/docs) documentation. The link we are using is going to be for Tonhub only, but you could play around [Tonkeeper links](https://github.com/tonkeeper/wallet-api), for example. In the documentation, you could also just figure out the structure of the URL you can use to provide some values.

Bin parameter everywhere is used everywhere to pass the `msg_body` once you want to send a message with certain parameters. This is exactly what we do here: we create a link for payment for Tonhub.

But before, we need to make a bot reply to the user. A user sent us the "Increment by 5" message with the keyboard we provided on the start. And we need to reply, so the user would know what he can do. We need to provide a link somehow. We can simply send the link, but we want to make it very user-friendly. So this is why we are going to reply with a message:

```
ctx.reply("To increment counter by 5, please sign a transaction:", {
    reply_markup: {
        inline_keyboard: [
            [{
                text: "Sign transaction",
                url: link,
            }]
        ]
    }
});
```

Then we create an extra parameter. There is such a thing as a `reply_markup` that can be either `InlineKeyboard`, `ReplyKeyboard`, `ReplyKeyboardRemove` or `ForceReply`. There are multiple options, and here we want to use `inline_keyboard`.

Last time we used a normal keyboard, at the same place under the input line. And now we are created an inline keyboard, as you see above. It has a few parameters: text, sign transaction, and URL. So we provided a parameter `url` with the link in `bot.hears`.
 
One thing I didn't mention before, but you should remember here: if we want to send a certain cell as a link, let's say, together with some string or link, we need to pack it into `base64`, like a cell of the message body.

Ok, looks like this is gonna work:

```
yarn start
```

Nothing failed,  so I go back to my phone. I open the keyboard provided by the start command and click "Increment by 5":

https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/6.4_2.jpg?raw=true

As you can see, we received a message that asks us to sign a transaction to increment by 5. We click **Sign** and get redirected to Tonhub. The transaction is sent. How can we check that the transaction actually affected the state of our contract? If you check your web app, you can see the **Counter Value** equals 15, though it has been 10 before.

### Umproving the chatbot even further

We can construct a certain user flow just with chatbot, and a user will interact with our blockchain at the back end. We don't have any user credentials on the back end, so we are actually providing him with the link to his wallet to pay. I hope it doesn't get you confused, because as a developer, you should always think of usability. And this is one of the things that can significantly improve it.

Web apps in Telegram let you create interesting, cool chat conversations with automatic messages. This enables you to create stunning projects with much value for your users. Let’s construct a similar link:

```
bot.hears("Deposit 1 TON", (ctx) => {
  const msg_body = beginCell().storeUint(2, 32).endCell();
```
   
We are going to put 2 for the deposit. We don’t need anything else, let's double check that in **wrappers > MainContract.ts**:

```
async sendDeposit(provider: ContractProvider, sender: Sender, value: bigint) {
  const msg_body = beginCell()
    .storeUint(2, 32) // OP code
    .endCell();
```

Next, we need to put the deposit command, otherwise we won’t be able to accept money on our contract. In index.ts we are just putting this integer equal to 2, 32 bits. And here we say it is going to be “Deposit 1 TON”, and we will actually request to provide a payment of 1 TON. It doesn't have to be a string.

```
bot.hears("Deposit 1 TON", (ctx) => {
    const msg_body = beginCell().storeUint(2, 32).endCell();

      
    let link = `https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/${
        process.env.SC_ADDRESS
    }?${qs.stringify(
        {
            text: "Deposit 1 TON",
            amount: toNano("1").toString(10),
            bin: msg_body.toBoc({ idx: false}).toString("base64"),
        }
    )}`;
 ```

So we are requesting user to send 1 TON to the contract with the message that says that it is a deposit. We type the message here and delete reply "Deposited 1 TON", because we don’t need it anymore:

```
ctx.reply("To deposit 1 TON please sign a transaction:", {
  reply_markup: {
    inline_keyboard: [
      [
        {
          text: "Sign transaction",
          url: link,
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
});
```  
  
So it's very simple. We form a message body, a link, text for the link, set 1 TON amount as the deposit, put the body into a string, and reply with a keyboard in a link. One more thing we need to do is to copy our bot deposit logic to withdraw logic:

```  
bot.hears("Withdraw 0.7 TON", (ctx) => {
const msg_body = beginCell().storeUint(3, 32).endCell();

      
let link = `https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/${
    process.env.SC_ADDRESS
}?${qs.stringify(
    {
        text: "Deposit 1 TON",
        amount: toNano("1").toString(10),
        bin: msg_body.toBoc({ idx: false}).toString("base64"),
        }
)}`;
    
ctx.reply("To deposit 1 TON please sign a transaction:", {
  reply_markup: {
    inline_keyboard: [
      [
        {
          text: "Sign transaction",
          url: link,
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
});
```  

Now we get back to the wrapper for the withdrawal. In `index.ts` we need to provide the amount that we want to withdraw:

```  
bot.hears("Withdraw 0.7 TON", (ctx) => {
const msg_body = beginCell().storeUint(3, 32).storeCoins(toNano(`0.7`))endCell();
```  

We added text about withdrawing 0.7 TON and next we put enough TON to pay the gas fees, because we’re going to get money here:

```  
let link = https://test.tonhub.com/transfer/${
  process.env.SC_ADDRESS
}?${as.stringify({
  text: "Withdraw 0.7 TON",
  amount: toNano('0.05').toString (10),
  bin: msg_body.toBoc({ idx: false }).toString("base64"), 
})}`;
```  

Then we edit the bot message:

```  
ctx.reply("To withdraw 0.7 TON please sign a transaction:", {
    reply_markup: {
        inline_keyboard: [
            [{
                text: "Sign transaction",
                url: link,
            }]
        ]
    }
});
```  

Let’s restart the bot with yarn start and get back to the application in Telegram. Now we can not only deposit, but also withdraw the same way:

https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/6.4_3.jpg?raw=true

Now let’s go to the [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) of web applications in Telegram, and read more about what is available in this SDK. Here we have `initData` and `initDataUnsafe`. These are used when we want to send some raw data when we initiate the web app. With `version` we can check the version of the bot API available in the user's Telegram app. With `platform` we can detect the platform. We can also adjust the color scheme, tune theme parameters — these options are provided by Telegram documentation. We can check if it's expanded, set the viewport height.

What we need now is `sendData` — a method to send data to the bot. When this command is called, service message with data is sent to the backed bot, containing the data of a given length. Important thing here is that after you're running this command, a message is sent into your Telegram. Basically, once you run `sendData` function, you are sending a message that should be handled by your back-end bot that we just created. And it would look like this how you handle it:

```  
bot.on(message("web_app_data"), (ctx) => ctx.reply("ok"));
```  

You also need to import the message from **telegraf/filters**:

```  
import { message } from "telegraf/filters";
```  

You can send here a sticker or just a message, but you want to filter web app data. Here you will receive the data that was sent from your web application. It's important to know this is made for closing, so once you run sendData method, the web app is closed.

### Conclusion

This is pretty much it. We've learned many things today. We actually figured out how to use one of the best ways to deliver your app to the people. TON is about mass adoption and it's important for you to master your mind around how to build your apps so they can be integrated into the carrier. If Telegram is the carrier for all these many people, TON is the blockchain that we love very much, and the platform is ready for this amount of people, why don't you build your apps and bring the scalable technology into the place where this amount of users is already waiting for your products?

I'm super happy that now you’re equipped for that. I hope that everything was clear for you, that whatever you've learned is going to help you build your product. See you in the next chapters. Thank you!
