# Chapter 6. Lesson 3. Setting up a backend project for chatbot

###### tags: `Chapter 6`

Let's see how to *install the SDK* that enables us to use the APIs of the TWA (Telegram Web App). I open `App.tsx` file in the project we did in the previous chapter and enter the command:

```
yarn add @twa-dev/sdk
```

Great, we installed it. Now we are going to *import the web app* and start interacting with it. First, we are going to show the platform to a user within our interface — this is useful if you want to do different functionality based on the platform. Second, we’ll add a button to trigger some action.

Let's start with the platform. We'll make the text bold, and add WebApp platform. We'll show it on the screen.


```
return (
  <div>
    <div>
      <TonConnectButton />
    </div>
    <div>
      <div className='Card'>
        <b>{WebApp. platform}</b>
        <b>Our contract Address</b>
        <div className='Hint">{contract_address?.slice(0, 30) + "...")</div>
        <b>Our contract Balance</b>
        {contract balance && (
          <div className= 'Hint'>{fromNano(contract_balance)}</div>
        )}
      </div>
```


The second thing is the action. We're going to *create a function* `showAlert` that will be triggered to show alert:


```
function App() {
  const {
    contract_address,
    counter_value,
    recent_sender,
    owner_address,
    contract_balance,
    sendIncrement,
    sendDeposit
    sendWithdrawalRequest
  } = useMainContract();



  const { connected } = useTonConnect();

  const showAlert = () => {
    WebApp.showAlert("Hey there!");
  };
```


It doesn't require authentication, so we can simply *show it above the part that is going to be shown only for authorized users*. So we’re going to change here for `showAlert`. This is how the whole `return` section will look like:

```
return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <TonConnectButton />
      </div>
      <div>
        <div className='Card'>
          <b>{WebApp.platform}</b>
          <b>Our contract Address</b>
          <div className='Hint'>{contract_address?.slice(0, 30) + "..."}</div>
          <b>Our contract Balance</b>
          {contract_balance && (
            <div className='Hint'>{fromNano(contract_balance)}</div>
          )}
        </div>

        <div className='Card'>
          <b>Counter Value</b>
          <div>{counter_value ?? "Loading..."}</div>
        </div>

        <a
          onClick={() => {
            showAlert();
          }}
        >
          Show Alert
        </a>

        <br />

        {connected && (
          <a
            onClick={() => {
              sendIncrement();
            }}
          >
            Increment by 5
          </a>
        )}

        <br />

        {connected && (
          <a
            onClick={() => {
              sendDeposit();
            }}
          >
            Request deposit of 1 TON
          </a>
        )}

        <br />

        {connected && (
          <a
            onClick={() => {
              sendWithdrawalRequest();
            }}
          >
            Request 0.7 TON withdrawal
          </a>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

It is that simple. Now we commit the files and push to GitHub:

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "TWA SDK integrated"
git push
git push origin master
```

### Leveraging GitHub actions

As you remember, we have GitHub actions configured, so our app is going to be built and deployed all the way to the GitHub pages. And we see that it's already in process:

![TWA SDK integrated - action](https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/6.3_1.png?raw=true)

GitHub actions are powerful. You can save so much time just by delegating things there. We’ll also have another action running here, the one that publishes our GitHub page from the separate branch. Wait for it to finish too.

But as you can see, we are not able to detect the platform here because the web app object is simply not available as we are not inside of Telegram. So this is just a draft publish that we did, something that you need to clean up with multiple checks to understand that your user is in Telegram. Now we can go to mobile Telegram and see how it works inside the messenger.

My platform is iOS. As I said, this is just a draft publish, so we can make it look much better later on. If I click show alert, it shows me the popup:

![Web app in Telegram](https://github.com/klauss-z/temp/blob/main/6.3_2.jpg?raw=true
)

TWA SDK is giving you a lot of power. All you need to do is read the documentation, which teaches a lot of things that you can do, like specifying the platform, color schemes, some theme parameters, making it expanded, setting up the viewport height.

Another interesting thing is control of the buttons, [main button](https://github.com/twa-dev/SDK/blob/master/src/react/MainButton/Readme.md) and [back button](https://github.com/twa-dev/SDK/blob/master/src/react/BackButton/Readme.md). You can use these components and attach actions to them. You have so much control, and your web app is actually becoming a very accessible application that interacts with Telegram. You could put such a big functionality and great user experience into it.

If I close the web app in Telegram, I can see that it is still a chat. So if you want to create the best user experience with your application on a whole, you should use the hybrid approach: keep some functions in the web app and some in the chat commands. You can maintain a conversation with your user and use your web app only for certain things that people are used to doing in GUI.

In the next lesson, we are going to do the very same functionality with the increment by five, the counter, and also request for withdrawal, deposit funds. We are going to do the same thing, but with chat comments. It's up to you what you want to use for your product and where you're going to build things. Anyway, we are going to learn how it all works. Also, we'll learn how to pass the information from the web app into the telegram chatbot, and create a chatbot that operates this conversational part.

The web app is responsible for functionality. It is authorizing the wallet, keeping the session. But the chatbot,  as a separate application, is going to maintain the conversation with the user. There must be a connection, so the web app can pass information to the chatbot. As a result, your conversation keeps up with whatever happens in the web part.

See you in the next lesson. And once again, I want to remind how proud I am that you’ve made it this far through this course. See you soon.
