# Chapter 6. Lesson 2. Pack dapp as a TWA in Telegram chatbot

###### tags: `Chapter 6`

What does it take to create a bot in Telegram? It is super easy. You just need to text one very special account in Telegram, named [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). Today, we are going to create a bot, choose a name for it, and integrate our existing app into the menu button of this bot.

In the dialog with BotFather we click **Start** and see multiple options. Go to the menu and press **Create a new bot**. Next, we are asked how we want to call our bot, let it be **TON&CO Tutorial**. Now we need to choose the name. Regular names are always ending with **bot**. If we try just **tonandcotutorial** as a name, we will be required to give a name with **bot** postfix, so I'll name it **tonandcotutorialbot**. You can come up with some better names for your project but this one is okay for the sake of testing.

I got the _HTTP API key_. We will need it later, not in this or the next lesson. We’ll use it for creating the chatbot command interface.

Now we go to the menu, click **Edit your bots**, choose our bot and go to **Bot settings**. In bot settings we choose **Menu button**. Then we press **Configure menu button**. It is asking to send the URL to be opened on tapping the Menu button of our bot. This is exactly the link we got in the [previous lesson](https://github.com/markokhman/func-course/blob/main/Chapter%205/Lesson%205.md) after publishing the app to GitHub Pages:

```

```

Next, it is asking for the title. The title will be simply **Counter**. So a user can click **Counter** and my app will open. Then we can go back to the bot.

One more thing: in the bot settings you can edit the name, the about text, the description, and even the picture. Editing commands will allow you to have more than one button in the menu. You’ll have enough time to play around with your bot; right now we’ll focus on how our menu button is going to work.

I open our bot. click **Start**. Here I see my **Counter** button, so if I click it, it is asking me if I’m ok to proceed to the website. I click OK, and the bot opens our app. There I can adjust the height — this can also be done with the SDK I told you about.

In our app, we click **Connect Wallet**. I choose Tonkeeper and get request for connecting the wallet. Now, when the wallet is connected, my app is also authorized. I'm closing the counter, and when I open it again, it still keeps the session because this is a web app.

But it's not just a simple web app: it gives us a lot of possibilities to interact with our bot. Our bot interface can be very different, and give us a whole new level of quality. So in the next lesson, we're going to learn more about the SDK, how to make it work even more efficiently and how to interact with Telegram itself. And later on, we'll also learn how to build solid chat interfaces that are working with the web app we just built. Stay tuned, next two lessons are going to be very interesting.
