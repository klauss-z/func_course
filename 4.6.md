# Chapter 4. Lesson 6. Verifying contract's source code
###### tags: `Chapter 4`

Now as we have the contract deployed to the mainnet, we can start to *verify the contract code*. As we mentioned in the previous lesson, it is super important to make sure that the users of your contract know exactly what is going to happen with their funds once they're going to send it to the contract address.

So as you can see in the explorer after sending your contract to mainnet, the code is not verified. But in a verified contract, anybody who wants to know the contract logic can easily read it. How do we do that?

### Uploading to TON Verifier

Recently TON received a very important instrument, [TON Verifier](http://verifier.ton.org). Here you upload your source code, then it is compiled, the code cell is formatted, and its hash becomes a proof that the code didn’t change. 

This code and this hash cell is later stored in the decentralized way, so any explorer can retrieve the source code and ensure that the code didn't change before. This way, there is no need to somehow guarantee code consistency. There is no centralized body for it — it is a registry controlled by a number of guys, who can confirm your code is unchanged.

Now we are going to *connect our wallet, upload our code here and deploy the transaction of storing it* in the decentralized way in IPFS or other service used under the hood. This time and in the next few lessons we are going to use [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) wallet, so you can get familiar with more wallets.

At the moment TON Verifier is working on the mainnet, so we’ll test it in real life. Usually you do this only once when you deploy the final contract. You don't need to worry about spending money on that, because this is something similar to buying, let's say, an SSL certificate. Actually you pay to provide the data on your contract to the chain, so explorers can retrieve your code.

Let’s start. I scan the QR code with the mainnet Tonkeeper wallet and authorize TON Verifier to request me for transactions. Now let's copy the address of the contract we’ve deployed to the mainnet and paste it to the search box of TON Verifier.

As we can see, the contract is not verified, obviously. Now we would need to provide TON Verifier with a source (.func in our case) code of our contract. To do this, we *open our project folder, find “contracts” subfolder and choose main.fc file*. Then *upload stdlib.fc from “imports” subfolder* – if not, you’ll get an error on compiling. Finally, *specify the directory in the stdlib.fc line on the webpage* (“imports” in our case) and *press Compile*.

If successful, you’ll get the message: “Great! Compile output hash matches this on-chain contract”. *Click Publish*. Then, Tonkeeper will ask to confirm the transaction. As I said, it will cost me a little, 0.5 tons. After we confirm, the transaction will need some time to get on-chain. In the end, when our verification is published, we can click View Verified Contract and see our verified source code. Now anybody who wants to interact with our contract can see the source code. Here, TON Verifier also lets us run the getter methods and get balances.

Now in explorers our source is marked as verified. It will take a few minutes to distribute the code to the decentralized registry I mentioned before. Then our code will be available for reading with explorers by any user. We can recheck it with another explorer, for example [TON API](https://tonapi.io/). 

Great! We have our contract verified now, and we're ready to create a front end part to interact with our contract. We deployed to the mainnet just to show how it would work in real life for the real project. For the next chapter we should also deploy this contract to the testnet, because we are going to test a lot and create a front end for this contract.

### Deploying to the testnet

As you remember from the [previous lesson](https://github.com/markokhman/func-course/blob/main/Chapter%204/Lesson%205.md), deploying to the testnet is quite easy. This command will help:


```
yarn blueprint run
```


In response it will ask me what network I want to deploy to. I'm *choosing testnet*. Then I *choose the type of my wallet — TON Connect compatible mobile wallet*, because we are going to work with TonConnect to authorize the front end actions with a transaction made from the wallet. 

For this deployment, I'm going to use Tonkeeper as well. With a QR code *I authorize Tonkeeper* to work with my local project. I confirm the transaction. Then, transaction on the contract deployment is sent, I confirm it, and… awesome! The contract is deployed.

We need to do one more thing. In the next chapters we are going to create a front end for our contract. And we don't want to spend real mainnet money to test all the interactions that we're going to work with. So, we need our contract to function with testnet addresses.

Let’s *change the most recent address and the owner address of the test wallet* connected to my Tonkeeper app right now:

```
const myContract = MainContract. createFromConfig(
  {
    number: 0, //initial value of the counter
    address: address ("KQBMjM3cGuQ315MLsdqw/wEat26aG1a2b0DFHMIschNfp5R-K"),
    owner address: address
      "KQBM;M3cGuQ31SMLsdqwwEat26aG1a2b0DFHMIScnNfp5R-K"
    ),
  },
```

Basically, I'm going to change the initial state, so the deployment address must be different. And also it will be on the testnet, of course. Now I'm going to *deploy the contract to testnet with these new addresses*. Consider this as a preparation for the next chapter where we’ll create the front end.

Let’s repeat the command we used above:


```
yarn blueprint run
```

I choose “testnet”, then “Tonhub wallet”, just like we did with other deployments. Now I scan the QR code to open the testnet app sandbox, which is just a testnet version of TonHub. There I confirm the transaction and I wait for my contract to be deployed on testnet. Yes, it is deployed, and we can find its address in the explorer.

We don't need to verify it here; we are going to use it mostly for testing. *Save the address of this contract* you see in the explorer – you’ll need it in the next lessons to build the front end.

I'm very excited about what we're going to do next. See you soon!
